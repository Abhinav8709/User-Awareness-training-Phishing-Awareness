# User-Awareness-training-Phishing-Awareness
I recently participated in Mastercard's job simulation on the Forage platform,
and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate
on a Security Awareness team at Mastercard.
I worked on a project to identify phishing emails and design security awareness
training courses. Through this job simulation, I built my skills in
problem-solving, data analysis, and data presentation and practiced them in a
real-world context.
Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working in cybersecurity and
I'm excited to apply these skills on a Security Awareness team.
